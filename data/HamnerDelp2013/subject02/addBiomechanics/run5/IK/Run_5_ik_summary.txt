The input data for the following markers were modified to enable
automatic processing:

  - WARNING: Trial segmentation was not enabled, but the time range of trial "Run_5" where markers are present and force was non-zero is not equal to the full time range of the trial. We recommend enabling trial segmentation, which will trim this trial to the time range [0.166667, 3.683333]..
  - WARNING: Trial Run_5 was trimmed to the intersection of the marker and force plate data, ([0.05, 3.791667]), since the time ranges in the uploaded files did not match..
