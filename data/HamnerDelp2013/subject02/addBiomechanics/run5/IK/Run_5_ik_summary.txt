Trial 'Run_5': Inverse Kinematics Summary
---------------------------------------------

Automatic processing achieved the following marker errors, averaged
over all frames of this trial:

  - Avg. Marker RMSE      = 3.82 cm
  - Avg. Marker Max Error = 7.63 cm

Markers with large root-mean-square error:

  - WARNING: Marker RTOE has RMSE = 6.42 cm!
  - WARNING: Marker RMT5 has RMSE = 5.69 cm!
  - WARNING: Marker LTOE has RMSE = 5.31 cm!
  - WARNING: Marker RTB3 has RMSE = 5.18 cm!
  - WARNING: Marker LMT5 has RMSE = 4.79 cm!
  - WARNING: Marker LPSI has RMSE = 4.62 cm!
  - WARNING: Marker LACR has RMSE = 4.57 cm!
  - WARNING: Marker RPSI has RMSE = 4.28 cm!
  - WARNING: Marker RCAL has RMSE = 4.16 cm!
  - WARNING: Marker RTB1 has RMSE = 4.12 cm!
  - WARNING: Marker LCAL has RMSE = 4.09 cm!
  - WARNING: Marker LMEL has RMSE = 4.03 cm!
  - WARNING: Marker RACR has RMSE = 4.00 cm!

The input data for the following markers were modified to enable
automatic processing:

  - WARNING: Trial segmentation was not enabled, but the time range of trial "Run_5" where markers are present and force was non-zero is not equal to the full time range of the trial. We recommend enabling trial segmentation, which will trim this trial to the time range [0.166667, 3.683333]..
  - WARNING: Trial Run_5 was trimmed to the intersection of the marker and force plate data, ([0.05, 3.791667]), since the time ranges in the uploaded files did not match..
