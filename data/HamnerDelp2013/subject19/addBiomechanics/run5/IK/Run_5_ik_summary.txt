Trial 'Run_5': Inverse Kinematics Summary
---------------------------------------------

Automatic processing achieved the following marker errors, averaged
over all frames of this trial:

  - Avg. Marker RMSE      = 1.94 cm
  - Avg. Marker Max Error = 5.06 cm

Markers with large root-mean-square error:

  - WARNING: Marker LACR has RMSE = 4.69 cm!
  - WARNING: Marker RACR has RMSE = 4.04 cm!

The input data for the following markers were modified to enable
automatic processing:

  - WARNING: Trial segmentation was not enabled, but the time range of trial "Run_5" where markers are present and force was non-zero is not equal to the full time range of the trial. We recommend enabling trial segmentation, which will trim this trial to the time range [0.025, 5.483333]..
  - WARNING: Trial Run_5 was trimmed to the intersection of the marker and force plate data, ([0.025, 5.483333]), since the time ranges in the uploaded files did not match..

The following model coordinates that hit joint limits during inverse
kinematics:

  - WARNING: elbow_flex_l hit upper bound on frames 9-13.
  - WARNING: elbow_flex_l hit upper bound on frames 86-89.
  - WARNING: elbow_flex_l hit upper bound on frames 164-170.
